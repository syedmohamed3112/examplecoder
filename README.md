#sentiment analysis for marketing
Importing the dataset.
The dataset can be obtained from the authentic resources and can be imported into our code editor using read_csv.
The next crucial step is to find out the features that influence the sentiment of our objective.
Once we draw the conclusion based on the visualization, we can move on to the next step which is creating a 'wordclouds'.
The next step is to classify the reviews into positive and negative.
Now we will create wordclouds for both the reviews.
The amount of obtained wordclouds in the dataset can be understood with the help of bar graphs.
The model can be built using-
First, clean the data and make sure all the preprocessing stages are followed.
The next step is to split the data frame which contains only the required features.
Create a bag of words which means go for vectorization where text can be converted into integer matrix.
Now we will import logistic regression which will implement regression with a categorical variable.
Now let's split our data into independent variable and target.
Let's take the training dataset and fit it into the model.
Next, we can take the test dataset and make the prediction.
The final task is to test the accuracy of our model using evaluation metrics.
