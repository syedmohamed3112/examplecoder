SENTIMENTAL ANALYSIS FOR MARKETING 
Problem Definition 
A) Problem Statement
-> Text often contains a mix of positive, negative, and neutral sentiments, making it challenging to categorize overall sentiment accurately. 
->Sentiment in marketing can vary seasonally or due to trends and fads. Sentiment analysis models should account for such variations. 
->Marketers often require real-time or near-real-time sentiment analysis to respond swiftly to emerging trends or customer concerns. 
B) Objective 
->Develop a sentiment analysis solution to help marketers gain actionable insights from customer feedback and social media content. 
* Understanding Customer Sentiment 
* Customer Feedback Analysis: 
* Customer Segmentation 
* Identifying Trends 
* Pedictive Analytics 
* Customer Experience Enhancement 
Design Thinking: 
1. Empathize: Understand Stakeholder Needs 
-> Conduct interviews and surveys with marketing teams to understand their pain points and goals related to sentiment analysis. 
-> Gather feedback from customers to understand their expectations and how they want brands to engage with their sentiments. 
2. Define: Identify the Problem and Scope 
-> Clearly define the problem you want to solve with sentiment analysis, such as improving customer feedback analysis or monitoring brand reputation. 
-> Set specific objectives and key performance indicators (KPIs) for your sentiment analysis project. 
-> Prioritize and scope the project based on available resources and the most pressing needs.
3. Prototype: Create Prototypes and Mockups 
-> Develop prototypes of the sentiment analysis solution, such as sample dashboards or reports. 
-> Use wireframes or mockup tools to visualize the user interface and data presentation. 
-> Test the prototypes with marketing teams and gather feedback on usability and functionality. 
4. Test: Collect Feedback and Iterate 
-> Conduct usability testing with marketing users and customers to evaluate the effectiveness of the sentiment analysis tool. 
-> Analyze the feedback and identify areas for improvement. 
-> Iteratively refine the prototype based on feedback and insights from testing. 5. Implement: Build and Deploy the Solution 
-> Develop the sentiment analysis solution, incorporating feedback and 
improvements from the prototype phase. 
-> Ensure the solution integrates with relevant data sources and tools used by marketing teams. 
-> Implement necessary data privacy and security measures to protect customer data. 
6. Scale: Expand and Customize 
-> Once the sentiment analysis solution proves successful, consider expanding its usage to different marketing campaigns, channels, or departments. 
-> Customize the tool to meet the unique requirements of different marketing initiatives. 
7. Educate and Train: Empower Users 
-> Provide training and resources to marketing teams to maximize their 
proficiency with the sentiment analysis tool. 
-> Offer ongoing support and educational materials to ensure effective
utilization. 
-> Applying design thinking to sentiment analysis in marketing can lead to more user-centric and effective solutions, enhancing customer satisfaction, improving brand perception, and driving marketing success. Remember to keep the focus on empathy, user feedback, and iterative improvement throughout the process.
   
Project Scope and Objectives:
Project Scope:
The scope of the sentiment analysis project in marketing encompasses the following key aspects:
1.Data Sources: 
                   The project will focus on collecting and analyzing data from various online sources, including social media platforms, review websites, blogs, and forums, to capture consumer sentiments related to the company's brand, products, or services.
2.Sentiment Classification:
                   The project will implement natural language processing and machine learning techniques to classify sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral, as well as identify specific emotions or aspects influencing sentiment (e.g., joy, anger, satisfaction, product quality, customer service).
3.Real-time Monitoring: 
                    The sentiment analysis system will be designed to provide real-time monitoring capabilities, allowing for immediate responses to emerging trends and issues in consumer sentiment.
4.Competitor Analysis:
                     In addition to analyzing the company's own sentiment, the project will consider sentiment analysis of key competitors to gain a comparative advantage and understand market dynamics.
5.Report and Visualization: 
                       The project will generate clear, actionable reports and visualizations, making it easy for marketing teams to interpret and act upon the sentiment analysis results.
Project Objectives:
The objectives of the sentiment analysis project in marketing are as follows:
1.Consumer Insights:
                   Gain a deeper understanding of consumer perceptions, preferences, and attitudes toward the company's products and services, enabling more targeted marketing campaigns.
2.Issue Detection:
                     Detect and address potential issues, concerns, or negative sentiment early on to prevent reputational damage and improve customer satisfaction.
3.Trend Identification:
                    Identify emerging trends, topics, and conversations within the market to capitalize on opportunities or adapt marketing strategies proactively.
4.Real-time Response:
                         Enable marketing teams to respond swiftly to sentiment fluctuations by implementing timely adjustments to campaigns, customer service, or product offerings.
5.ROI Improvement:
                      Improve return on investment (ROI) by aligning marketing efforts more closely with customer sentiment and preferences.
6.Enhanced Customer Engagement: 
                      Use sentiment analysis to enhance customer engagement by tailoring content and interactions based on consumer sentiments and emotions.
Detailed Project Plan:
Developing a detailed plan for sentiment analysis in marketing involves a structured approach to collecting, analyzing, and leveraging sentiment data. Below is a step-by-step plan that outlines the key stages of such a project:
1. Project Initiation:
                        Define Project Goals: Clearly articulate the objectives and expected outcomes of the sentiment analysis project in the context of your marketing strategy.
                         Identify Stakeholders: Determine the key team members and stakeholders involved, including marketing, data analysts, and IT professionals.
2. Data Collection:

from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import   CountVectorizer
from nltk.tokenize import RegexpTokenizer
token = RegexpTokenizer(r'[a-zA-Z0-9]+')
cv = CountVectorizer(stop_words='english',ngram_range = (1,1),tokenizer = token.tokenize)
text_counts = cv.fit_transform(data['sentences'])
#Splitting the data into trainig and testing
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(text_counts, data['feedback'], test_size=0.25, random_state=5)
#Training the model
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
MNB = MultinomialNB()
MNB.fit(X_train, Y_train)
#Caluclating the accuracy score of the model
from sklearn import metrics
predicted = MNB.predict(X_test)
accuracy_score = metrics.accuracy_score(predicted, Y_test)
print("Accuracuy Score: ",accuracy_score)

 
OUTPUT:
Accuracuy Score:  0.9111675126903553

CONCLUSION:
    Our understanding and knowledge about sentiment analysis and its solutions remain very limited. The main reason is that this is a NLP task, and NLP has no easy problems. Another reason may be due to the popular ways of doing research, which rely too much on machine learning.
